        Hi, my name is Nicolas Ortiz and I'm a photographer based in Ottawa,
        Ontario. I have been taking photos for over 4 years and have honed my
        skills through extensive travel and experience working with various
        clients.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
        I have a passion for capturing the beauty of the world around us and
        sharing it with others. I am always looking for new and exciting
        subjects to photograph and enjoy collaborating with clients to bring
        their vision to life.
      </p>
